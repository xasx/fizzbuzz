This is just a repo with some code trials.

For example, when I discover a new cool Framework or one of their functions and see an immediate use case, I often create proof-of-cenceptys. If they are common enough, I push them to here :)

Furthermore, GitHub encouraged me to write this readme.
I hope that most of the code here is somewhat self-explaining and does not really need a dedicated README.
